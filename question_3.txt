the code are not the same, first of all, for method1, there are two functions and each of these two functions got corresponding callback function.
That means the after the event be evoked, the callback will be executed, however, how the window print 1 and 2 will not be in order; 
for the async function, delay_print_promise() and another delay_print_promise() will be executes in order,
but console.log(1) and console.log(2) will not be executed by order.
